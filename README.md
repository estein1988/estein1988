<h2> 💻 👏 ⬇️    Welcome to Elliott's GitHub!   ⬇️ 👏 💻 </h2>
I'm a full-stack software engineer and a Minneapolis, Minnesota transplant living in Colorado. I have 10+ year's experience in corporate oil & gas land management, where I oversaw mineral rights throughout the United States, Canada and Gulf of Mexico. I enjoy bringing these past skillsets through code by applying my work to data-driven projects. When I'm not figuring out how to make things work on my computer I you can find me in the mountains with my Australian Shepard 🦮 🗻, growing vegatables in my garden 🌶 🥦, or managing one of my many fantasy football teams 🏈. 

<h3> A brief intro on some of my work </h3> 
**7-10 Home Split** - ([Hosted Site](https://home-split-7-10.firebaseapp.com/login) ([Frontend](https://github.com/estein1988/710-home-fe) | [Backend](https://github.com/estein1988/710_home_split_be) | [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijFS5tFKtY4))

* Home prices in Denver are **expensive**. In 2020, the year of the pandemic, which brought on many economic consequences not seen since the 30s, home prices have *increased* 12%. 7-10 Home split allows users to create a profile with their budget, hobbies, interests and lease-end date and lease-end date in-mind. In the app, users can browse ~150 live real-estate listings in the Denver area, and like listings they are interested in. The user can see who else has liked the same listing, what their interests are, and perhaps contact them if they want to schedule a meeting to determine if it would be a good fit. Finally, there is a mortgage calculator in the app that shows the stark difference in monthly payments if the user was on their own or with a partner.

**OpenCountries** - ([Hosted Site](https://open-countries.firebaseapp.com/) ([Frontend](https://github.com/estein1988/covid-travel-fe) | [Backend](https://github.com/estein1988/covid_travel_be) | [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEkAa672bLw)

* The majority of the countries in the world imposed travel restrictions in the spring of 2020 due to COVID-19. I made this app to help guide users to make informed decisions about their travel plans. Users can enter the site and search current case counts by coordinates. A world map is also displayed with important restrictions such as who can travel to each country and what sort of quarantine measures are in place when they arrive. There is also a table that shows current U.S. statistics on the pandemic, with different breakpoints considering if it is a positive or negative statistic.

**Main Street Valuations** - ([Hosted Site](https://main-street-valuation.firebaseapp.com/) ([Frontend](https://github.com/estein1988/main_street_frontend) | [Backend](https://github.com/estein1988/covid_travel_be) | [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZAjlKbOnCk)

* Main Street Valuations is intended to be a web-app that allows users to better track their finances. After entering a couple of years of past income statements, users can view their results through a UI-dashboard. The dashboard comes with important metrics such as revenue/expenses/profit, but also with graphs and a table that shows their income statements. There is also a valuation metric given to the business owner, and how much the business may fetch on the open market. 2020 has been a difficult year for the majority of small business owners, so I hope this gives you a better idea of some areas you can save money or grow your business!
